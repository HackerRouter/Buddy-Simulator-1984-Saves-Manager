This application allows you to backup your current game save file and reset it. Also, you can launch the game by a hidden command and you can play a corrupted version of Buddy Simulator 1984.(I tried my best on finishing the fake game, please try it out!)

I haven't found a way to edit the save file, so you can't use it to edit your save at present.

So...

Hey! DON'T CLOSE the tab before you read all of the texts, please.

Yeah, yeah, just keep reading this, thank you. :)

If you still don't know how to use it after reading the textx below, you can watch this video: [Buddy Simulator 1984 Saves Manager Official Guide](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CS4y1S7Ac)

>**Quick tip for those who don't want to read texts down here:**

>Type `run bs1984sm` to run BS1984 Saves Manager.

>Then type `backup` to backup your game save file.

>Your saves（not backups) are actually located in the registry. `HKEY_CURRENT_USER > SOFTWARE > Not A Sailor Studios > Buddy Simulator 1984`
