# Buddy-Simulator-1984-Saves-Manager

Declaration:
The Buddy Simulator 1984 Saves Manager has nothing related to the game developers of Buddy Simulator 1984.
------

This application allows you to backup your current game save file and reset it. Also, you can launch the game by a hidden command and you can play a corrupted version of Buddy Simulator 1984.(I tried my best on finishing the fake game, please try it out!)

I haven't found a way to edit the save file, so you can't use it to edit your save at present.

So...

Hey! DON'T CLOSE the tab before you read all of the texts, please.

Yeah, yeah, just keep reading this, thank you. :)

>**Quick tip for those who don't want to read texts down here:**

>Type `run buddy simulator 1984 saves manager` to run BS1984 Saves Manager.

>Then type `backup` to backup your game save file.

>Your saves are located in the registry. `HKEY_CURRENT_USER > SOFTWARE > Not A Sailor Studios > Buddy Simulator 1984`

Hidden Commands For Anekom Official OS

[`Uninstall Buddy Simulator 1984`] This will allow you uninstall the fake Buddy Simulator 1984, but it actually does nothing now(I haven't write codes to make it delete the fake game)

[```"Run"" "" "```] You will be able to launch Buddy Simulator 1984(on Steam) by typing it for 4 times. Also, you can type "quit" to quit the real game.(*~~Once I type this in game and it didn't say "'Run' by itself is not valid". I guess this is a bug of the game, maybe? That's why I add it, lol~~*)**Do not type the quotation marks.**
