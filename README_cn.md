该软件允许你备份你的当前游戏存档文件或是重置它。同时，你也可以通过一个隐藏指令启动游戏，还可以玩"损坏版"的BS1984。(我耗了很多心血来制作假游戏，强烈建议尝试！)

我还没找到编辑存档文件的方法，你现在还不能用它编辑存档。

所以……

嘿！别关网页啊！还有内容呢！

对，没错，继续往下读，感谢~ :)

读了还不知道怎么用的话，请看这个视频: [Buddy Simulator 1984存档管理器官方指南](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CS4y1S7Ac)

>**太长不看版:**

>输入 `run bs1984sm` 来运行BS1984存档管理器。

>接着输入 `backup` 来备份游戏存档.

>你的存档（不是备的份) 其实是在注册表里的： `HKEY_CURRENT_USER > SOFTWARE > Not A Sailor Studios > Buddy Simulator 1984`

[```"Run"" "" "```] You will be able to launch Buddy Simulator 1984(on Steam) by typing it for 4 times. Also, you can type "quit" to quit the real game.(*~~Once I type this in game and it didn't say "'Run' by itself is not valid". I guess this is a bug of the game, maybe?

------
DON'T TYPE `Reset` if you DON'T HAVE ANY BACKUPS.

And DON'T TYPE `Delete All` if you RESET your current game save file and DIDN'T REPLACE it with your backups.
